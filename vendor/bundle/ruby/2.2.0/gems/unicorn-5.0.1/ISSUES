== Bugs in related projects

unicorn is sometimes affected by bugs in its dependencies.  Bugs
triggered by unicorn in mainline Ruby, rack, GNU C library (glibc),
or the Linux kernel will be reported upstream and fixed.

For bugs in Ruby itself, we may forward bugs to
https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/ and discuss+fix them on the ruby-core
list at mailto:ruby-core@ruby-lang.org
Subscription to post is required to ruby-core, unfortunately:
mailto:ruby-core-request@ruby-lang.org?subject=subscribe

For uncommon bugs in Rack, we may forward bugs to
mailto:rack-devel@googlegroups.com and discuss there.
Subscription (without any web UI or Google account) is possible via:
mailto:rack-devel+subscribe@googlegroups.com
Note: not everyone can use the proprietary bug tracker used by Rack,
but their mailing list remains operational.

Uncommon bugs we encounter in the Linux kernel should be Cc:-ed to the
Linux kernel mailing list (LKML) at mailto:linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
and subsystem maintainers such as mailto:netdev@vger.kernel.org
(for networking issues).  It is expected practice to Cc: anybody
involved with any problematic commits (including those in the
Signed-off-by: and other trailer lines).  No subscription is necessary,
and the our mailing list follows the same conventions as LKML for
interopability.  There is a kernel.org Bugzilla instance, but it is
ignored by most developers.

Likewise for any rare glibc bugs we might encounter, we should Cc:
mailto:libc-alpha@sourceware.org
Keep in mind glibc upstream does use Bugzilla for tracking bugs:
https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/

== Submitting Patches

See the HACKING document (and additionally, the
{SubmittingPatches}[https://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/SubmittingPatches]
document distributed with git) on guidelines for patch submission.
